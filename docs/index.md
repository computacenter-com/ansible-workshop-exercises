# Welcome to the Ansible Workshop!

Ansible is a radically simple IT automation system. It handles configuration management, application deployment, cloud provisioning, ad-hoc task execution, network automation, and multi-node orchestration.

You will learn all about Ansible:

1. starting with the basics of understanding foundational command line activities
2. applying what you’ve learned to implement Ansible automation controller to your enterprise use cases.
3. learn about the Ansible future and network automation

You’ll start off by writing your first Ansible playbook, work on Jinja templates, and implement higher-level Ansible roles. Next you’ll get started on automation controller, understand inventory and credential management, projects, job templates, surveys, workflows and more.

!!! tip "How to use the guide"
    The exercise guide contains loads of explanation for every topic, **don't just skip over everything** and only *copy-paste* the commands to *finish* the exercises. **Take your time!**  
    Some tipps:

      * Every *code* block has a **small copy button** inside (**if the code block is meant to be copied!**)!

        ```yaml
        example: use the copy button on the right!
        ```

      * Sometimes you'll encounter **expandable** *call-outs*! **Click the call-out title**.

        ??? success "Solution"
            This contains the steps to achieve a **Challenge Lab**.  
            **Try without this first!**

        ??? failure "Error"
            This contains additional information when you encounter **expected** errors.

    !!! info
        The [Ansible Basics](ansible-basics-overview.md) and [Automation Platform](automation-platform-overview.md) exercises are **guided**, if you follow the steps (**the exercises build on each other**), you'll be fine.  
        You'll encounter some **challenge labs**, they don't show you how its done, you have to use the knowledge of the previous exercises to achieve the solution.  
        The [Projects](projects-overview.md) are **not guided** (or *less* guided), still, if you follow the steps, you'll achieve the solution!

**After finishing this lab and the exercises you are ready to start using Ansible for your automation requirements!**

## Time planning

The time required to do the workshops strongly depends on multiple factors: the length of the workshop. the number of participants, how familiar you are with Linux in general and how much discussions are done in between.

Having said that, the exercises themselves should take roughly 4-5 hours, not counting the projects.
